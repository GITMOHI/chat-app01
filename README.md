# Text
(Ongoing project...)
Text is a modern chatting web app designed to provide a seamless communication experience for users. It allows users to register or log in, create profiles, and engage in one-on-one or group chats with real-time messaging. Users can react to messages, customize chat themes, and use features like message search, read receipts, typing indicators, and notifications for new messages. The admin panel enables moderators to manage users, monitor chats for violations, and generate usage reports. With end-to-end encryption and robust data security measures, Text ensures privacy and reliability for all users.
